There were three hackathons organised by the coordinators, first was to perform EDA and implement a linear regression model on the house rent prediction dataset. 
Second was to build a regression model and to optimize it using hyperparameter tuning for predicting future sales of the items of shops.
Third one was the project of the udacity course Intro to Machine Learning. The task was to perform data analysis and build a binary classification model to identify person of interest from the enron dataset depending on various features.
